# ReqEngActivities
This is a Python program based on a Requirements Engineering process. The program provides a menu with several options, each representing a phase of the requirements engineering process. The user can choose an option by entering a number from 1 to 6.
# Requirements
Download Python 3 and Visual Studio Code.
# Usage
To run the program, execute the following command in the terminal: python activities.py
This will start the program and present a menu with several options. Follow the prompts to input the necessary information for each phase of the requirements engineering process.
The available options are:
Inception
Elicitation
Elaboration
Specification
Validation
Exit
# Phases of Requirements Engineering
Inception
This phase involves gathering information about the problem requirements, project constraints, and major features and functions required.
Elicitation
This phase involves gathering information about usage scenarios.
Elaboration
This phase involves breaking down the requirements into different types like scenario-based, activity-based, class-based, and behavioral elements.
Specification
This phase involves creating a specification document based on the gathered requirements.
Validation
This phase involves verifying that the gathered requirements meet the necessary criteria, including meeting problem requirements, project constraints, and major features.
# Conclusion
This program is a simple tool to simulate the process of Requirements Engineering. It provides a framework to gather, elaborate, specify, and validate requirements.
